```

- seattle_airbnb.ipynb ==> Notebook to investigate Airbnb in the year 2016 in Seattle.
- calendar.csv         ==> Data on the availability and price of the listings
- listings.csv         ==> Listing information of rentals in Seattle.
- reviews.csv          ==> Reviews of rentals in Seattle.

## Questions:
 1) When are listings typically available? During the weekend or during the weekdays? Is there any seasonality of 
    when listings are available?
 2) Which features have the biggest impact on the daily price of a listing?
 3) How accurately can we predict the daily price of a listing, based on the data from the listing data?

## Results

Listings are rented the most in January and Thursdays thru Sundays. The bedrooms, the number of bed, and how many people can be accomidated in the listing, had the largest positive correlation to price, based on the contiuous data.

I was able to predict the housing prices with a R2_Score of ~60.
